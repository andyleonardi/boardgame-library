<h4>Description</h4>
<b>Context</b>
<p>I have been fortunate that my company's Culture Club maintains an extensive board game library, where we occasionally facilitate team-building exercises.</p>
<p>We allow employees to borrow and take these games home, but we do require them to check them out by scanning a QR code, which will open up a Google Form for them to fill up.</p>

<b>Problem statement</b>
<p>What if we want to add additional features to the check out process (for eg: recommendations, map of which shelves to return the game to, browse other similar games)?</p>
<p>Google Forms works well as a borrow form, but it does not have the capabilities to include all the above value-adds</p>
<p>Also, it looks very plain & functional.</p>
<b>Introducing a new web app</b>
<p>What if we design a website where we maintain a repository of all our games, where employees can interact with the app to checkout games and discover new games, where we track all the checkouts in a database, a database which allows admins to log in to the app and view popularity of each games?</p>
<p>Features built on this version of the web app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>View list of all games (with filters)</li>
  <li>Checkout a game</li>
  <li>View recommendations on similar games</li>
  <li>Return a game, and then view which shelves to return it to</li>
  <li>(Admin) Login function</li>
  <li>(Admin) Add & delete games from the library, edit game details</li>
  <li>(Admin) View simple statistics like # of games being borrowed, # of unique users</li>
</ul>
<b>Things still to do:</b>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>A more comprehensive stats dashboard</li>
  <li>Combining multiple filters currently not working</li>
  <li>Other QoL updates</li>
</ul>
</p>
